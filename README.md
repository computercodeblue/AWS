## Why?

After migrating to AWS in 2023 and starting development with AWS Lambda, I discovered there was going to be some boilerplate code to tie some of the AWS services together, for example a Lambda function that uses a database on an EC2 instance with secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager.

## Projects
